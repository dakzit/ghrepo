Delete Branch:
git branch -d <branch> # will delete branch locally

git push â€“u origin <branch name> # To push any new branch to remote

git push origin --delete <remoteBranchName> # will delete branch remotely

Push Local Repository to GitHub:
# Since we have already set up a local Git repo, we are going to push that to GitHub
- Copy the URL & paste it in git shell
$ git remote add origin <git repo URL>
$ git push --set-upstream origin main 

Edit Code in GitHub:
We can edit the README.md file in GitHub, add some changes to the code, and then commit the changes.

Git Pull from GitHub:
Anytime team on a project, it is important that everyone stays up to date. We should get the most recent changes to your local copy.

pull is a combination of 2 different commands;

-fetch # fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.
$ git fetch origin
$ git status # We would see we are behind the origin/master by 1 commit. This should be the updated README.md
$ git log origin/main # To view the log

-merge # merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch.
$ git merge origin/main
$ git status # Our local git should be up to date

Git Pull:
pull is a combination of fetch and merge. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.
Let make changes to README.md in github
$ git pull origin

# That is how you keep your local Git up to date from a remote repository.

Intro to database: mySQL:
We all deal with data on a daily basis. 
1. when we take a photo & upload it to our acct on a social media. FB, IG,
2. A list of our favorite songs on our smartphone.
3. when we browse an e-commerse to shop for stuffs.

Database is merely an organized collection of structured information, or data that can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

MYSQL:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is released under an open-source license.

Launch EC2 18.04 LTS instance in AWS
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ wget -c https://repo.mysql.com//mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb # download the repository package
$ sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.13-1_all.deb #  install the MySQL repository package 
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server # to start installing MySQL
$ sudo mysql_secure_installation # to adjust security to the MySQL Server

# It will prompt you some security options that you should choose in order to secure the MySQL server:
Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y

sudo systemctl status mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql # start it automatically at system startup

mysql>
mysql> show databases; # to display all databases in the current server

 Note: To clear out from the screen, use CTrl+L together

 CREATE TABLE product (productID int, product_amount varchar(20), product_region varchar(20)); # To create a table

 show columns from product; # This will show tables columns and its datatypes
